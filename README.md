What makes NoPaste special is that it works with **no database**, and **no back-end code**. Instead, the data is compressed and **stored entirely in the link** that you share, nowhere else!

### Because of this design:

-   🗑️ Your data **cannot be deleted** from NoPaste
-   🔞 Your data **cannot be censored**
-   👁️ The server hosting NoPaste (or any clone of it) **cannot read or access** your data
-   ⏳ Your data will be accessible **forever** (as long as you have the link)
-   🔀 You can access your data on **every NoPaste clone**, including [your own](https://github.com/bokub/nopaste/wiki/Deploy-your-own-version-of-NoPaste)
-   🔍 Google **will not index** your data, even if your link is public

> **Note:** This project is a copy of [Topaz's paste service][topaz-example], with a reworked design and a few additional features (syntax highlighting, line numbers, offline usage, embedding...)
